If you find yourself aimlessly adding :sparkles: `print` :sparkles: statements while debugging your code, this is for you. :handshake:

Constable inserts print statements directly into the AST at runtime to print variable assignments and other details.

It turns this ðŸ”½ ....
```python
@constable.trace(['a', 'b'])
def do_something(a, b):
    a = a + b
```
.... into this ðŸ”½ during runtime
```python
# During runtime, print statements will be added for every assignment on 'a' & 'b'.
# Resulting in something like -
def do_something(a, b):
    a = a + b
    print(f"wowww i wonder who put this print here! a = {a}")
```

Monitor the state of specified variables at each assignment operation, providing a step-by-step view of variable changes!

```sh
$ pip install constable
```

### How does it work?

The `constable.trace` decorator uses Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in much the same way we add `print`(s) to debug states. During runtime, it prepares and inserts `print` statements into the function's AST after every assignment operation (`ast.Assign`, `ast.AugAssign` and `ast.AnnAssign`), and then executes the modified code in a separate namespace with `exec`.

:memo: Use at your own risk in mission-critical environments, or with unknown agents, as compiling and executing code during runtime can cause unwanted side effects. For all use cases that matter, use `pdb` instead.

#### Print variable assignments and execution info.

```python
import constable

@constable.trace(['a', 'b'])
def example(a, b):
    a = a + b
    c = a
    a = "Experimenting with the AST"
    b = c + b
    a = c + b
    return a

example(5, 6)
```

Output -

```
constable.trace: example:19 -
    a = a + b
    a = 11
    type(a) = <class 'int'>

constable.trace: example:21 -
    a = "Experimenting with the AST"
    a = Experimenting with the AST
    type(a) = <class 'str'>

constable.trace: example:22 -
    b = c + b
    b = 17
    type(b) = <class 'int'>

constable.trace: example:23 -
    a = c + b
    a = 28
    type(a) = <class 'int'>

constable.trace: example -
    args: (5, 6)
    kwargs: {}
    returned: 28
    execution time: 0.00029278 seconds
```

You can also use it on its own to track function execution info. 

```python
@constable.trace()
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

add(5, 6)
```

Output - 

```
constable.trace: add -
    args: (5, 6)
    kwargs: {}
    returned: 11
    execution time: 0.00003767 seconds
```


#### @trace
The `trace` function is the decorator to add `print` statements into the AST.

```python

def trace(
    variables=None,
    exec_info=True,
    verbose=True,
    use_spaces=True,
    max_len=None
):
    """
    An experimental decorator for tracing function execution using AST.

    Args:
        variables (list, optional): Variables to trace. Traces all if None. Default is None.
        exec_info (bool, optional): Whether to print function execution info. Default is True.
        verbose (bool, optional): Whether to print detailed trace info. Default is False.
        use_spaces (bool, optional): Whether to add empty lines for readability. Default is False.
        max_len (int, optional): Max length of printed values. Truncates if exceeded. Default is None.

    Returns:
        function: Decorator for function tracing.
    """
